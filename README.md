# Filters

WordPress [actions](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/actions/) and [filters](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/filters/) are wonderful because they allow plugin, theme and core developers to offer large amounts of customization with very little effort.

#### Action -  
WordPress actions let you append your own functionality at a specific process
##### Filter 
WordPress filters allow you to change and modify data as it is processed

#### THE ANALOGY
[Mike](https://github.com/kipmyk) is making a burger, and he offers to add/modify the layers as you wish.

THE BREAKDOWN
<p>&nbsp;<img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kipmyk/filters/main/inc/assets/analogy.png" alt="Anology of Actions and Filters" /></p>
As we can see do_action function lets you put anything between the layers, and apply filter lets you change what the layer is. Now, lets use the burger analogy with the code:

WordPress Hook: Action

#### Susan Request

[Mike](https://github.com/kipmyk), Please add pickles before lettuce

`add_action('before_vegetable', 'my_custom_layer_before_vegetable');`

`function  my_custom_layer_before_vegetable(){`
      
      echo 'I am the pickles layer';

`}`

Then you can add pickles and coriander before lettuce

`add_action('before_vegetable', 'pickles_layer_before_vegetable', 1);`

`function  pickles_layer_before_vegetable(){ `
      
      echo 'I am the pickles layer';

`}`

`add_action('before_vegetable', 'coriander_layer_before_vegetable', 2);`

`function  coriander_layer_before_vegetable(){` 
      
      echo 'I am the coriander layer';

`}`

Notes: the number 1 & 2 stand for priority, if you wanted coriander to appear above pickles then you just need to switch the priority.

WordPress Hook: Filter

Nathan comes, Hi [Mike](https://github.com/kipmyk), I donâ€™t want lettuce on my burger, please use pickles instead

`add_filter('vegetable_filter', 'change_vegetable_filter' );`

`function change_vegetable_filter( $default ){`
      
      return 'I am the pickles layer';

`}`

I want a crispy patty

`add_filter('patty_filter', 'make_it_crispy');`

`function make_it_crispy( $meat ){`

      $cooked = deep_fry_task( $meat );`
      return $cooked;

`}`
